- The demo was configured to run with an SQL database hosted locally by SQLEXPRESS: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads.
- To configure the database locally, in the sln folder, run the command `Update-Database` in the Package Manager Console.
- The database will be created based on the migrations already in the repository.
